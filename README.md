# CIR-DDG

**Backbone-agnostic residual correction of antibody–antigen affinity changes (ΔΔG) with explicit cross-chain geometry.**

CIR-DDG treats ΔΔG prediction as *output-level repair*: a frozen base predictor is combined with a masked additive residual driven by 22 explicit physical descriptors of the mutation-centered interface (9 cross-chain distance features, 9 contact-count features, 4 partner-chemistry features). The correction is gated by a scope mask so that it activates only on single-point mutations at antibody–antigen interfaces (cross-chain distance ≤ 5 Å); predictions outside this cohort are conserved by construction.

The module reads only a scalar base prediction and a fixed descriptor vector, so it can be attached to predictors whose internals are unavailable, retrains in minutes, and can be audited feature by feature.

This repository contains the code and experiment scripts for the paper:

Trained checkpoints (≈300 MB) and raw training logs are not tracked in this repository; see **Data availability** below.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Core experiments need only PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, SciPy and scikit-learn. Two backbones have extra requirements (see `requirements.txt` comments): DiffAffinity needs a JAX/Haiku environment, and ESM-IF needs `fair-esm`. Neither is needed to train or evaluate CIR-DDG itself on the released predictions.

## Quick start

Train the CIR-DDG residual module on top of a backbone's released predictions:

```bash
python src/train.py \
    --base-predictions <backbone_predictions>.npz \   # keys: keys, ddg, ddg_pred, complexes
    --geometry data/interface_geometry_all.npz \      # keys: keys, geom
    --output results.json
```

The interface mask is auto-detected from the descriptor (minimum cross-chain distance ≤ 5 Å); a custom mask can be passed with `--interface-mask`. Training uses complex-level cross-validation so that no complex appears in both training and evaluation.

The experiment folders mirror the paper's analysis chain: main results (`01_main`), mechanism probing (`04_r2_mechanism`), ablations (`05_ablation`), external zero-shot validation (`07_external_validation`) and the case study (`08_case_study`). Each folder contains a runnable script (`run.py` / `generate_tables.py`) and the exact result files reported in the paper.
